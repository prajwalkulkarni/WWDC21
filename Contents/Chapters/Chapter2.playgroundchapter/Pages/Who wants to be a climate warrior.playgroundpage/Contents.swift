## Who wants to be a climate warrior ?
 
 
 **Rules-Recap**
 
 
 This a climate-change based quiz, which consists of 7 questions.
 Answer all the questions correctly to win a "million dollars" üòâüí∞.
 
 There is a single lifeline available that can be used at any stage if you are not sure of the right answer. Using the lifline eliminates two wrong options and leaves you with the correct answer and an additional wrong option. The lifeline can be used only once.
 
 Answering a question wrong would mean that the task is unaccomplished, but there's nothing to worry about, you can always restart the quiz and replay.
