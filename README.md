My submission for Swift student challenge 2021 is a playground about climate change that aims to educate people about climate change and what one can do to minimize it.

This playground consists of two chapters. The first chapter takes you through several interactive elements and providing useful information along, whereas the second chapter is a quiz based on climate change which helps people make environment-friendly decision on a day-to-day basis.
